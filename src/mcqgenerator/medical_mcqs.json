        "correct_answer": "B) Consult with the patient's addiction specialist before prescribing opioids for pain management",
        "reasoning": "Given the patient's history of substance abuse and his current treatment for substance use disorder, it is crucial to take this into consideration when managing his acute dental pain. The correct answer is to consult with the patient's addiction specialist before prescribing any opioids (B). This coordination facilitates a decision that considers the risk of relapse while adequately managing the patient's pain. Prescribing opioids without this consultation (A) could jeopardize the patient's recovery process. Ignoring the patient's pain (D) is not an appropriate approach as it neglects the patient's current suffering and could lead to further complications. Non-opioid analgesics (C) might not be sufficient for severe dental pain; nevertheless, this option should be considered after consultation with the addiction specialist. The option of involving the addiction specialist aligns with the Dental Guideline on Prescribing Opioids for Acute Pain Management.",

Given the significant symptoms and the failure of conservative management, surgical intervention is indicated. While all the options listed are potential treatments for cervical radiculopathy, anterior cervical discectomy with fusion is the most appropriate in this case. This procedure allows for direct decompression of the nerve root, which can lead to a greater likelihood of symptom relief. Furthermore, fusion prevents instability which could result from discectomy alone. The use of a ray titanium cage for fusion has been shown in randomized clinical trials to be effective. Option A, transforaminal steroid injections, could provide temporary relief but is not a definitive treatment. Option C, posterior cervical foraminotomy, is a less invasive option but may not provide as definitive or long-lasting relief as discectomy with fusion. Option D, conservative management, is usually the first step in management, but given the patient's significant symptoms and the duration of these symptoms, it is less likely to be effective.",

However, her high BMI and osteoarthritis are relative contraindications to surgery. Non-operative treatment should be attempted first, with surgery reserved for failure of conservative management. If surgery becomes necessary, ligament reconstruction should be considered due to the presence of persistent laxity and insufficient tissue. Ligament repair is generally the first line of treatment, but it may not be suitable in this case due to the patient's osteoarthritis. Microfracture is not the best choice because the lesion diameter is >15mm, which is associated with worse clinical outcomes.

His MRI shows mild degenerative disc disease, but no nerve impingement. How should the patient's progress in a work rehabilitation program be evaluated?",
        "options": [
            "A) Solely through self-reported functional assessments",
            "B) Solely through pain intensity rating",
            "C) Through a combination of self-reported functional assessments and evaluation of work behaviors",
            "D) Through a combination of MRI findings and pain intensity rating"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "C) Through a combination of self-reported functional assessments and evaluation of work behaviors",
        "reasoning": "In this particular case, the patient's functional ability and work behaviors should be assessed to evaluate progress in a work rehabilitation program. Self-reported functional assessments help to assess the patient's physical aspect, while the evaluation of work behaviors helps to assess the behavioral aspect of work rehabilitation. This is in line with the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries' work rehabilitation guideline, which emphasizes the importance of assessing both physical and behavioral outcomes in a work rehabilitation program. Option A is incorrect because it only considers the physical aspect. Option B is incorrect because pain intensity rating may not match well with disability. Option D is incorrect because MRI findings do not necessarily correlate with the patient's functional ability or work behaviors.",

He has been treated with NSAIDs and physical therapy but his symptoms have not improved. EMG and nerve conduction studies are performed and reveal slowing of the radial nerve across the elbow, suggesting radial tunnel syndrome. There are no signs of cubital tunnel syndrome or carpal tunnel syndrome. The patient has type 2 diabetes and hypertension, both well-controlled. He wants to return to work as soon as possible. What would be the best management approach in this case?",

        ],
        "correct_answer": "B) Proceed with surgical release of the radial tunnel",
        "reasoning": "Given the patient's persistent symptoms despite conservative management, positive findings on EMG and nerve conduction studies, and desire to return to work as soon as possible, surgical intervention is the best option. Option A is incorrect because conservative management has already been tried and has failed to improve symptoms. Option C is suboptimal as corticosteroid injections are usually reserved for patients with mild symptoms or for those who are unable to undergo surgery. Option D is also inappropriate because, while occupational therapy and job modification can help in managing symptoms, they are not curative and would not address the underlying radial nerve compression.",

The pain started after lifting heavy materials at work, which he does on a regular basis. His pain scale is 7/10 and it is not relieved by over-the-counter analgesics. His medical history is significant for mild depression. An MRI of the lumbar spine shows mild disc bulging at L4-L5 without neural impingement.

        "correct_answer": "C) Start with intense physical conditioning involving the employer and occupational medicine providers",
        "reasoning": "According to the guideline, intense physical conditioning appears more beneficial than multidisciplinary exercise focused on pain reduction to decrease the proportion of workers off work in both the short and long term, especially when the employer and occupational medicine providers are involved (Option C). Option A is not the most effective approach as per the guideline. Option B is not optimal as involving the employer and occupational medicine providers increases the effectiveness of the intense physical conditioning. Option D is not appropriate because the guideline emphasizes that exercise plans should be individualized in patients with pain due to the wide variability in contribution from physical and psychological components of pain.",

Although stenosis is prevalent in his age group and often asymptomatic, his symptoms indicate a need for intervention. 2. Given the patient's history of allergic reactions to contrast media and asthma, Gadolinium enhanced imaging (Option B) is contraindicated. 3. Option A is not the best next step because non-operative care is recommended before resorting to surgery. Specifically, a course of non-operative care of at least 6 weeks, including active rehabilitation and epidural steroid injections, has been shown to be effective in treating low back pain. 4. Option D is unsuitable because \u03b2-blockers and interleukin-2 are relative contraindications to the use of a contrast/Gadolinium medium, not treatments for spinal stenosis. Therefore, the best next step in management is to attempt active rehabilitation and epidural steroid injections (Option C).",

She also has severe foraminal stenosis and significant disc height loss on MRI. Lumbar fusion is suggested when decompression is inadequate or significant instability exists. Option B is not the best choice because decompression alone may not provide sufficient relief in this patient.

NSAIDs (option B) can exacerbate asthma in some individuals, so they would not be the best choice for this patient. Non-prescription paracetamol (option D) may not be sufficient to manage severe pain from an impacted molar. Therefore, a combination of paracetamol and a low dose of codeine (option C) would be the most appropriate pain management option for this patient. This approach is supported by the study by Joshi A, Parara E, Macfarlane TV, which found that preoperative ibuprofen, diclofenac, paracetamol with codeine, and placebo tablets all provided relief of postoperative pain after removal of impacted third molars. However, codeine should be used cautiously in patients under 18, as recommended by the FDA.",

However, completion of a nerve conduction study for a presumptive case of CTS is required if time loss extends beyond two weeks or if surgery is requested. Immediate surgery (option A) is not the first line of treatment for CTS. Initially, conservative management like NSAIDs and wrist splinting (option B) is recommended. Systemic corticosteroids (option C) can be considered if initial treatment fails, but they are not the first line of treatment.
