This approach has been shown to decrease the utilization of lumbar spine fusion (Yanamadala et al., 2017). Option A may be too aggressive at this stage, especially considering the potential for adjacent segment degeneration after spine surgery (Xia et al., 2013). Option B may not be effective as the patient has already tried conservative management for 6 months with minimal relief. Option D is not ideal as it does not address the underlying issue and may lead to potential issues with medication overuse or addiction.",

Anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF) is a common surgical procedure for treating cervical radiculopathy due to disc herniation, especially when conservative treatments have failed or symptoms are severe. This procedure removes the herniated disc and any bone spurs that are pressing on spinal nerves, and then fuses the vertebrae together to stabilize the spine. 2. Posterior cervical foraminotomy is another surgical option, but it is typically reserved for cases where the disc herniation is located more laterally. 3. Transforaminal steroid injections can provide temporary relief for some patients, but they do not address the underlying issue of the herniated disc. 4. Conservative management with physical therapy and analgesics is often the first line of treatment, but in this case, the patient's symptoms have persisted for 6 months, suggesting that conservative treatments may not be sufficient. 5. The patient's comorbidities of diabetes and hypertension do not contraindicate surgery, but they would need to be well-controlled prior to the procedure.",

PTs are experts in function, body mechanics, strength, and mobility. They can assess strength and mobility impairments and form treatment plans to progress a patient's capacity, conditioning, and function toward safe performance of daily and job-oriented functions. While Occupational Therapists (OTs) and Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors (VRCs) also play important roles in work rehabilitation, the patient's primary need at this point is physical rehabilitation, which is best addressed by a PT. A psychologist might be involved if there were significant psychosocial barriers to the patient's recovery, but this is not indicated in the current scenario.",
